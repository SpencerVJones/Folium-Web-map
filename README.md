# Interactive Map with Folium
This Python script creates an interactive map using Folium, a powerful library for visualizing geospatial data. The map marks both places where I have lived and places I have visited, distinguishing them with different colored markers.

## Features:
- **Custom Markers:** Places I have lived are marked with blue icons, while places I have visited are marked with green icons.
- **Popup Information:** Clicking on each marker reveals additional information about the location, such as city and state.
- **Interactive:** The map allows users to zoom in/out and navigate across different areas seamlessly.

## Instructions:
- **Installation:** Ensure you have Folium installed. If not, you can install it via pip by running pip3 install folium in your terminal.
- **Execution:** Simply run the provided Python script to generate the interactive map.
- **Exploration:** After the script execution, open the generated HTML file (map1.html) to interact with the map in your web browser.
